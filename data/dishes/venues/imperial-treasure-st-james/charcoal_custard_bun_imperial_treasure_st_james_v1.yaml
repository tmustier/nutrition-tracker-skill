notes:
  - "Charcoal custard buns are a signature dim sum dessert featuring activated charcoal in the dough (for aesthetic black color) and a molten sweet custard filling."
  - "The custard filling is made primarily from salted egg yolk, butter, and sugar, creating a rich, flowing 'lava' center when steamed."
  - "Activated charcoal contributes negligible calories and is used purely for color/presentation."
  - "Energy calculated via Atwater: 4×3.8 + 4×23.3 + 9×8.8 = 187.6 kcal (matches 186 kcal within rounding)."
  - "Conservative estimate falls within published range (168-200 kcal) for similar dim sum custard buns."
  - "High in saturated fat due to butter and egg yolk content in filling. Moderate sugar from custard and dough."
