## Portion Size Standards

### Vegetable Sides (Based on Industry Standards)
- **Typical range**: 100-150g per restaurant side serving
- **Charred Green Beans estimate**: 142g total
  - Component breakdown: 120g green beans + 12g olive oil + 10g capers + 0.7g finishing salt
  - Rationale: Mid-range of typical restaurant vegetable side portions

### Estimation Methodology
Since Maset lacks published nutrition data or delivery platform presence:
1. **Component-based estimation** using USDA FoodData Central
2. **Recipe research** for similar French Mediterranean charred green bean dishes
3. **Industry standards** for restaurant vegetable side portions (ESTIMATE.md guidelines)
4. **Oil quantities** based on typical charring techniques (2 tbsp/pound from culinary sources)

---

## Challenges & Limitations

### Data Availability
- **No official nutrition data**: Maset does not publish allergen menus or nutrition PDFs
- **No delivery platforms**: Cannot cross-reference with Deliveroo/Uber Eats calorie counts
- **Website access**: Direct web fetches blocked (403 errors), requiring manual research
- **Limited menu visibility**: Full current menu not publicly documented in detail

### Estimation Confidence
- **Medium confidence** for charred green beans based on:
  - Strong USDA data for base components (green beans, olive oil, capers)
  - Consistent French Mediterranean preparation methods across similar venues
  - Standard restaurant portion sizing
  - Limited confidence on exact dish composition without official menu confirmation

## Future Research Opportunities

1. **Visit in person**: Obtain current menu, confirm dish names, photograph plates for portion verification
2. **Contact restaurant**: Request allergen information or ingredient lists
3. **Social media**: Monitor @maset.london Instagram for dish photos, menu updates, ingredient details
4. **Menu evolution**: Track seasonal changes, new dishes, ingredient substitutions

## Case Studies

### Charred Green Beans, Crispy Capers

**Estimated Components** (142g total):
- Green beans, cooked: 120g
- Olive oil (charring + frying): 12g
- Capers, fried crispy: 10g
- Finishing salt: 0.7g

**Key Nutritional Highlights**:
- 162 kcal per full portion
- Excellent source of vitamin K (62µg, 52% DV) from green beans + olive oil
- High in healthy fats (13.4g total, 71% MUFA from olive oil)
- Good fiber content (4.2g) with low available carbs (5.8g)
- Moderate sodium (516mg) from capers + finishing salt

**Estimation Method**:
1. Base green beans: USDA FDC#169141 (snap beans, cooked, boiled, drained)
2. Olive oil: USDA FDC#171413 (salad/cooking grade)
3. Capers: USDA FDC#172238 (canned), adjusted for absorbed frying oil
4. Salt: Standard finishing salt (0.5% of dish weight per ESTIMATE.md)

**Assumptions**:
- Green bean quantity based on mid-range restaurant vegetable side (100-150g range)
- Olive oil quantity estimated from charring requirements (~1 tbsp/8oz beans per culinary sources)
- Capers fried in olive oil, absorbing ~10% of weight in cooking fat
- Normal salt scheme (not light or heavy)

**Confidence Level**: MEDIUM
- High confidence in USDA component data
- Medium confidence in component proportions (no official recipe)
- Medium confidence in portion weight (no direct measurement)

## Notes

- **User note (2025-11-05)**: User SHARED the charred green beans side dish, consuming approximately HALF. When logging, adjust portion to 0.5× the full dish values.
- Maset is a new restaurant (opened October 2025), so menu and dish availability may evolve
- Consider updating this research if official nutrition data becomes available
- Future dishes should follow similar component-based estimation methodology until primary sources emerge
