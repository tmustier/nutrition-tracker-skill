# Junk Soho: Research Notes

## Venue Overview
Junk Soho is a premium burger chain with locations across London. Known for high-quality beef, artisanal buns, and creative sauce combinations. The truffle burger is one of their signature items.

## Truffle Smash Burger (v1)

### Dish Characteristics
- **Format**: Two thin smash-style patties (characteristic of smash burger preparation)
- **Premium positioning**: Truffle sauce (not standard ketchup/mayo) indicates gourmet positioning
- **Add-ons**: Fresh jalapeños and dill pickles suggest a menu-customizable item
- **Weight**: ~240g (user-measured)

### Ingredient Research

#### Ground Beef Patties (2x, ~50g each = 100g cooked)
- Premium burger restaurants typically use 80/20 (80% lean, 20% fat) ground beef for balance
- Smash burger preparation: thin patties seared at high heat on flat griddle, creating crispy exterior
- USDA FDC 168960 used: "Ground beef, 80% lean meat / 20% fat, cooked, pan-broiled"
- Justification: Matches preparation style and premium restaurant context

#### Burger Bun (~55g)
- Soft, white enriched bread typical of gourmet burger restaurants
- Not a "brioche bun" (higher fat/egg content) but enriched white bread
- USDA FDC 169541: "Bread, white, enriched"
- UK enriched bread includes vitamin D fortification (important for iodine/vitamin D calculation)
- Weight estimate: Standard burger bun is 45-60g; 55g represents mid-range for quality burger

#### Truffle Sauce (~35g total: 30g mayo + 5g truffle oil)
- Truffle sauce in restaurants typically = mayonnaise base + truffle pieces/oil
- Mayo component: USDA FDC 173570 ("Mayonnaise, regular")
- Mayo is 72g fat per 100g, primarily soybean oil base with egg emulsifier
- Truffle oil component: USDA FDC 170950 ("Oil, truffle")
- Truffle oil similar to olive oil in composition (high MUFA, ~70%)

#### Jalapeños (~8g raw)
- User specified as an add-on
- USDA FDC 170107: "Peppers, hot chile, jalapeño, raw"
- Contributes minimal macros but provides vitamin K, trace minerals, vitamin C
- Raw form preserves heat-sensitive nutrients

#### Dill Pickles (~15g)
- User specified as an add-on
- USDA FDC 170948: "Pickles, cucumber, dill"
- High sodium (873mg per 100g) is expected for fermented/brined pickles
- Minimal macro contribution

### Finishing Salt Estimation
- **Assumption**: 0.3% of burger weight = 72mg salt (conservative for restaurant burger)
- **Rationale**: Typical restaurant burgers add 0.3-0.5% finishing salt; 0.3% is conservative for gourmet venue where salt is controlled
- **Sodium contribution**: 72g salt × 40% sodium = 288mg additional sodium
- **Validation**: Total sodium 1021mg falls within typical restaurant burger range (900-1200mg)

### Micronutrient Estimation Strategy

#### High-Confidence Estimates (±15% or better)
- Selenium (36.6μg): Well-documented in beef (USDA) and enriched grains
- Zinc (6.6mg): Primary source beef, USDA data highly consistent
- Iron (5.4mg): Beef provides heme iron (highly bioavailable), bun provides non-heme iron
- B-vitamins: Enriched bread fortification data well-documented in UK fortification standards

#### Medium-Confidence Estimates (±20-40%)
- Vitamin D (2.1μg): Beef cattle feed affects levels; UK enriched bread fortification estimated
- Iodine (2.75μg): UK enriched bread is primary source; cattle feed fortification affects beef iodine content
- Chloride (1572mg): Derived from sodium using NaCl ratio (1.54×)

#### Low-Confidence Estimates (±50% or higher)
- Vitamin A (0.6μg): Jalapeños contribute trace amounts; beef/mayo/bun negligible
- Vitamin C (0.42mg): Only from jalapeños (0.12mg) and pickles (0.3mg)
- Omega-3 fatty acids (EPA/DHA trace): Grain-fed beef has minimal amounts; no fish sources

### Validation Results
- ✓ Energy within Atwater tolerance (599 kcal calculated, 597 kcal actual)
- ✓ Fiber split coherent (0.5g soluble, 1.4g insoluble = 1.8g total)
- ✓ Omega fatty acid profile coherent (10.5g of 11.9g PUFA accounted for)
- ✓ No null values; all 52 nutrients populated
- ⚠ Fat split: 4.6g unassigned (11% of total) = glycerol backbone + phospholipids (documented & expected for multi-source fats)

### Key Nutritional Insights

1. **Protein-rich**: 29.7g (60% of RDA for adult male) - primarily from beef
2. **High omega-6 LA**: 10.0g - driven by mayo soybean oil; suggests monitoring omega-3/6 ratio
3. **Mineral-dense**: Strong zinc (60% RDA), selenium (67% RDA), iron (68% RDA) profile
4. **Low vitamins A & C**: Represents typical beef burger limitation (no vegetables except garnish)
5. **Sodium moderate for restaurant burger**: 1021mg (44% RDA) - reasonable for fast-casual venue
6. **Cholesterol**: 97mg (32% RDA) - appropriate for meat + egg-based sauce

### Component-Based Methodology
This record uses component-based USDA estimation rather than vendor data (which isn't publicly available for Junk Soho). All USDA FDC sources are peer-reviewed and represent average nutrient profiles for food categories. Confidence levels reflect the inherent variation in natural foods and preparation methods.
