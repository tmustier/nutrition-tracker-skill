## Estimation Methodology

### Weight Estimation
1. **Raw weight**: 700g (mid-range of UK 600-800g standard)
2. **Cooking loss**: 25% (USDA data for grilled ribeye)
3. **Cooked beef**: 525g
4. **Additions**: 30g butter + 5g herbs + 3.5g salt
5. **Total dish**: 565g

### Nutrition Calculation Approach
- **Base**: USDA FoodData Central grass-fed beef ribeye (cooked)
- **Adjustments**: +15-20% fat for ex-dairy marbling characteristics
- **Dry aging**: Assumes nutrient concentration from ~15% water loss
- **Butter component**: Standard USDA butter nutrition (30g)
- **Salt**: 0.6% of dish weight finishing salt (~3.5g)

### Confidence Levels
- **HIGH (±10%)**: Macronutrients (protein, fat, carbs, energy)
  - Based on well-documented USDA ribeye data
  - Scaled for weight and cooking method

- **MEDIUM (±20-30%)**: Major minerals and B-vitamins
  - Zinc, selenium, iron, magnesium, phosphorus
  - B-complex vitamins (B1, B2, B3, B5, B6, B12)
  - Choline
  - Scaled from USDA grass-fed beef profiles

- **LOW (±50%+)**: Ultra-trace minerals
  - Chromium, molybdenum, boron, silicon, vanadium, nickel
  - Limited data available, estimated from general beef profiles

## Key Nutritional Notes

### Ex-Dairy Beef Characteristics
- **Higher marbling**: 15-20% more intramuscular fat than standard grass-fed
- **Yellowish fat**: Beta-carotene from grass feeding
- **Darker meat**: From mature animal (5+ years)
- **Grass-fed benefits**: Higher omega-3, vitamin E, vitamin K vs grain-fed

### Dry Aging Effects (30 days)
- **Water loss**: ~15% weight reduction
- **Nutrient concentration**: Protein and fat per 100g increase proportionally
- **Minimal vitamin loss**: Fat-soluble vitamins retained, water-soluble vitamins may reduce slightly
- **Flavor intensification**: Does not significantly alter base nutrition profile

### Restaurant Additions
- **Butter (30g)**:
  - Adds 215 kcal, 24.4g fat (mostly saturated)
  - Contributes vitamin A (219µg), vitamin D (0.4µg)
  - Traditional French steakhouse technique

- **Herbs (thyme, rosemary, garlic)**: Minimal macros, trace vitamins
- **Finishing salt**: 1400mg sodium from 3.5g salt

## Challenges & Gaps

1. **No official data**: Maset is new (opened Oct 2025), no published nutrition information
2. **Ex-dairy variability**: Fat content can vary ±15-20% based on specific animal
3. **Chef variation**: Butter and salt amounts estimated based on French steakhouse standards
4. **Dry aging specifics**: 30 days is established, but exact weight loss unknown
5. **Portion variation**: 600-800g range means ±14% weight variation possible

## Recommendations for Future Updates

1. **Confirm with venue**: Call Maset to verify raw weight and preparation details
2. **Photo analysis**: If available, use plate size reference to validate portion estimate
3. **Ultra-trace minerals**: Low priority for update unless specific health concern
4. **Seasonal variation**: Ex-dairy beef characteristics may vary by season/supplier

## Desserts Research

### Profiteroles, Chocolate, Chestnut Cream

**Estimation Challenge**: New venue, no nutrition data available from delivery platforms or official sources.

**Menu Context**: Described in reviews as "small, purposeful punctuation marks, each one finishing the meal with clarity" (The Infatuation). Other desserts include Tarte aux Figues with thyme and Fougasse d'Aigues-Mortes with orange blossom.

**Approach**: Component-based estimation using:
1. **Choux pastry shells** (55g): USDA FDC 174986 (Cream puff shell, prepared from recipe)
2. **Chestnut cream filling** (60g): Commercial crème de marron profile (sweetened chestnut purée)
3. **Chocolate sauce** (25g): Dark chocolate ganache (70% cocoa with cream)

**Portion Estimation Method**:
- Review description: "small, purposeful punctuation marks"
- French restaurant standard: 3-4 profiteroles per serving
- Generic profiterole weight: ~35g each (filled)
- Final estimate: 4 small profiteroles × 35g = 140g total

**Key Findings**:
- **Unique nutritional highlights**: Chestnuts provide vitamin C (15.6mg per serving), which is rare for a nut. Also high in manganese (1.08mg) and copper (0.61mg).
- **Sugar content**: 25.3g total, primarily from sweetened chestnut cream (19.2g) rather than chocolate (5g)
- **Iron**: 3.4mg per serving, predominantly from dark chocolate (1.75mg) and eggs in choux pastry (1.1mg)
- **B vitamins**: Good source of B1 (0.28mg), B2 (0.26mg), B3 (2.11mg), B6 (0.33mg), and folate (51μg) from eggs, flour, and chestnuts
- **Magnesium**: 38.7mg, with 14.3mg from dark chocolate and 20mg from chestnuts
- **Potassium**: 513mg total, majority (355mg) from chestnuts

**USDA Data Sources**:
- Cream puff shell: FDC ID 174986 (332 kcal/100g, 8.4g protein, 20.7g fat, 29.8g carbs)
- Roasted chestnuts: FDC ID 170190 (245 kcal/100g, 3.17g protein, 0.91g fat, 52.3g carbs)
- Dark chocolate (70-85% cocoa): Standard USDA profiles with dilution for ganache

**Confidence Level**: MEDIUM
- Portion size inferred from review descriptions (HIGH confidence for 3-4 profiteroles, MEDIUM for exact weight)
- Chestnut cream composition assumed as commercial crème de marron (MEDIUM - varies by brand)
- Chocolate sauce composition estimated as dark ganache (MEDIUM - composition varies)
- Component weights reasonable based on culinary standards (HIGH for typical ratios)

**Validation Results**:
- ✓ Energy calculation within tolerance (Atwater formula: 4×6.4 + 9×18.9 + 4×54.0 + 2×3.5 = 418.7 kcal vs 419.6 kcal stated)
- ✓ Omega fatty acids coherent (0.33g = 47.1% of 0.70g PUFA)
- ✓ Salt from sodium correct (0.525g)
- ⚠ Fat split incomplete (16.45g accounted for vs 18.90g total, missing 2.45g) - minor discrepancy likely due to additional trace fatty acids not individually quantified

- Desalting process crucial: reduces from 7000mg to ~80mg per 100g cod
- Finishing salt minimal in preparation

### Estimation Methodology

**Weight Estimation Process**:
1. **Research baseline**: Typical beignet recipes yield 18-32 pieces from ~500g brandade
2. **Size reference**: Golf ball-sized (50-70g range standard for appetizer fritters)
3. **Final estimate**: 50g beignet + 10g aioli = 60g total

**Component Calculation**:
1. Started with total weight (60g) and worked backwards
2. Brandade filling: 28g (47% of total)
   - Broke down into cod, potato, oil, cream based on traditional ratios
   - Traditional brandade: roughly equal parts cod:potato with oil added to taste
3. Batter coating: 15g pre-fry weight
4. Absorbed oil: 7g (12% absorption rate for deep-fried items)
5. Aioli: 10g (standard restaurant sauce portion)

**Desalted Cod Calculation**:
- Used USDA cooked cod (171956) as proxy for desalted cod
- Desalting reduces sodium by ~99% (7027mg → ~80mg per 100g)
- Maintained B12, selenium, protein from salt cod data
- Adjusted other nutrients proportionally

### Validation Results

✓ **Energy**: 4×6.8 + 9×22.5 + 4×9.0 + 2×0.8 = 267 kcal (calculated) vs 285 kcal (stated)
  - Difference: 6.7% (within 8% tolerance)
  - Likely due to rounding in component calculations

✓ **Fat split**: SFA 4.2 + MUFA 14.8 + PUFA 2.9 + trans 0.1 = 22.0g
  - vs total fat 22.5g
  - Difference: 0.5g (2.2%) - acceptable variance

✓ **Omega fatty acids**: 0.207g omega-3 + 2.5g omega-6 = 2.707g
  - vs PUFA 2.9g = 93.3% coverage
  - Excellent coherence

✓ **Salt from sodium**: 195mg × 2.5 / 1000 = 0.49g

### Confidence Assessment

**MEDIUM Overall Confidence** due to:

**HIGH Confidence (±10%)**:
- Macronutrients (P/F/C): Based on well-documented USDA sources
- Fatty acid profile: Olive oil dominance well-established
- Energy calculation: Validates within tolerance

**MEDIUM Confidence (±20-30%)**:
- Portion weight: Estimated from standard beignet sizes, not venue-specific
- Component ratios: Based on traditional brandade recipes, not Maset-specific
- Desalting effectiveness: Literature supports 99% reduction, but variable
- B-vitamins, major minerals: Scaled from USDA, reasonable estimates

**LOW Confidence (±50%+)**:
- Iodine: Highly variable in cod (22-720µg/100g range), used conservative 158µg/100g
- Ultra-trace minerals: Limited data, estimated from USDA generic profiles
- Exact batter composition: Assumed standard flour-egg-milk batter
- Oil absorption rate: Used 12% standard, actual may vary 10-15%

### Challenges & Research Gaps

1. **No official nutrition data**: Maset opened Oct 2025, no published nutrition information
2. **No delivery platform data**: Not found on Deliveroo/Uber Eats (dine-in only initially)
3. **Portion variability**: Restaurant portions may vary ±15-20% from 50g estimate
4. **Chef variation**: Oil content in brandade and frying time affect final macros
5. **Iodine variability**: Cod iodine content depends on diet and water source (22-720µg/100g range)
6. **Desalting variation**: Home desalting time varies, affects final sodium content

5. **Photo analysis**: If available, use plate/fork size reference to validate portion estimate
6. **Seasonal variation**: Cod quality and iodine content may vary by season
7. **Update iodine**: If user has thyroid concerns, refine iodine estimate with detailed research

## Sides Research

### Thick-Cut Frites

**Estimation Challenge**: No menu photos or official nutrition data for Maset frites. Estimated from French restaurant standards and food science literature on frying physics.

**Menu Context**: French Mediterranean restaurant emphasizing quality preparation. Thick-cut frites follow traditional French/Belgian style (not thin fast-food fries).

#### Component Analysis

**Portion**: 220g cooked (side serving)

**Component Breakdown**:
```
364g raw potato (after 45% frying loss → 200g dehydrated structure)
  → Energy: 288 kcal
  → Protein: 7.8g
  → Carbs: 65.8g (61.1g available + 4.7g fiber)
  → Potassium: 1,518mg
  → Vitamin C: 33.1mg (partially heat-stable)
  → Vitamin B6: 1.09mg

+ 20g absorbed vegetable/sunflower oil (9.1% of final weight)
  → Energy: 177 kcal
  → Fat: 20g (2.3g SFA, 5.0g MUFA, 12.7g PUFA)
  → Vitamin E: 9.0mg
  → Omega-6 LA: 12.7g

+ 1.1g finishing salt (0.5% of dish weight)
  → Sodium: 440mg
  → Chloride: 668mg

= 221g total (rounded to 220g)
  → 465 kcal, 7.8g protein, 20.3g fat, 61.1g available carbs
```

#### Key Finding: Thick-Cut Geometry Reduces Oil Absorption by 40%

**Surface Area Physics**:
- **Thin fries (6-9mm)**: 15-25% oil absorption (high surface-to-volume ratio)
- **Thick-cut frites (13mm)**: 8-12% oil absorption (low surface-to-volume ratio)
- **Oil uptake mechanism**: Water evaporates → creates porous structure → oil fills voids during cooling
- **Maset estimate**: 9.1% absorption (20g oil / 220g total weight)

**Research Evidence**:
- Multiple food science studies confirm inverse relationship: oil absorption ∝ 1/(fry thickness)
- Belgian frites (13mm standard): documented 8-12% absorption range
- Fast-food thin fries: documented 15-25% absorption range
- **40% reduction** in absorbed oil for thick-cut vs thin-cut geometry

#### Frying Process & Water Loss

**Double-Frying Technique**:
1. **First fry (160°C)**: Starch gelatinization, structure formation, ~30% water loss
2. **Rest period**: Allows interior steam to equilibrate
3. **Second fry (180°C)**: Maillard browning, crispy crust, additional 15% water loss
4. **Cooling**: Oil uptake occurs as steam escapes, creating micro-voids

**Weight Transformation**:
- Raw potato: 364g
- Water loss during frying: 45% (164g evaporated)
- Dehydrated potato structure: 200g
- Oil absorbed: 20g (fills ~12% of void space created)
- Final weight: 220g

#### Nutritional Highlights

**Excellent Sources**:
- **Potassium**: 1,518mg (32% of 4,700mg daily target) - natural in potatoes
- **Vitamin B6**: 1.09mg (77% of 1.4mg daily target) - heat-stable
- **Vitamin E**: 9.0mg (60% of 15mg daily target) - from vegetable oil
- **Vitamin C**: 33.1mg - partially preserved despite heat sensitivity
- **Fiber**: 4.7g includes resistant starch from cooling after first fry

**Fatty Acid Profile**:
- **Omega-6:3 ratio**: 318:1 (high due to vegetable oil)
- **MUFA**: 5.0g (25% of fat) - from vegetable oil blend
- **PUFA**: 12.7g (63% of fat) - predominantly omega-6 linoleic acid
- **Saturated**: 2.3g (11% of fat) - lowest of three fat types

#### Portion Estimation

**UK Restaurant Standards**:
- General frites: 180-240g cooked weight (McCain pub data)
- French restaurant: Mid-range 220g typical for side
- Belgian/French style: 13mm width cut (vs 6-9mm for thin fries)

**Thickness Specification**:
- Belgian Flanders: 10-11mm standard
- Belgian South: 12-13mm standard
- French bistro: 13-15mm typical
- **Maset estimate**: 13mm (traditional French Mediterranean style)

#### USDA Data Sources

**Primary Data**:
- **Potato (raw)**: FDC ID 170027 - Russet potato, flesh and skin
  - Complete macro/micronutrient profile scaled to 364g
- **Vegetable oil**: Standard USDA sunflower/canola blend profiles
  - Vitamin E: 45-90mg/100g (sunflower oil)
  - Fatty acids: ~11% SFA, ~25% MUFA, ~63% PUFA

- PMC: Heat transfer and water evaporation analysis

#### Validation Results

✓ **Energy (Atwater formula)**:
- Calculated: 4×7.8 + 9×20.3 + 4×61.1 + 2×4.7 = 468 kcal
- Stated: 465 kcal
- Variance: ±0.6% (excellent match)

✓ **Fat split**: SFA 2.3 + MUFA 5.0 + PUFA 12.7 + trans 0.02 = 20.02g
- vs total fat 20.3g (98.6% accounted for)

✓ **Omega fatty acids**: 0.04g omega-3 + 12.7g omega-6 = 12.74g
- vs PUFA 12.7g (100.3% coverage, excellent)

✓ **Salt from sodium**: 462mg × 2.5 / 1000 = 1.16g

#### Confidence Assessment

**MEDIUM Overall Confidence**:

**HIGH (±10%)**:
- Macronutrients: Well-documented USDA potato + oil profiles
- Water loss: 45% is well-established in food science literature
- Oil absorption: 9.1% within documented 8-12% range for thick-cut
- Energy validation: Atwater calculation within ±1%

**MEDIUM (±20-30%)**:
- Portion size: Based on UK restaurant standards (180-240g range), not Maset-specific
- B-vitamins, major minerals: Scaled from USDA potato profiles
- Vitamin C retention: ~36% of raw potato value (heat sensitivity variable)
- Frying oil type: Assumed vegetable/sunflower (standard practice)

**LOW (±50%+)**:
- Ultra-trace minerals: Limited USDA data for boron, silicon, vanadium, nickel
- Iodine: Potato iodine content soil-dependent (1-3µg/100g typical)
- Exact cut thickness: 13mm estimated from French restaurant standards

#### Scientific Context

**Surface Area Principle**:
```
Oil absorption ∝ Surface Area / Volume

Thin fry (6mm × 6mm × 60mm):
  - Surface area: 1,584 mm²
  - Volume: 2,160 mm³
  - SA:V ratio: 0.73 mm⁻¹

Thick frite (13mm × 13mm × 80mm):
  - Surface area: 4,836 mm²
  - Volume: 13,520 mm³
  - SA:V ratio: 0.36 mm⁻¹

Result: Thick frites have 51% lower SA:V ratio
→ Absorbs ~40% less oil per gram of potato
```

**Frying Physics**:
1. **Heat transfer**: Oil heats potato surface to 100°C+
2. **Water evaporation**: Interior moisture converts to steam
3. **Crust formation**: Maillard reaction creates crispy exterior
4. **Structural changes**: Starch gelatinization provides rigidity
5. **Oil uptake**: Cooling creates negative pressure → draws oil into voids

#### Challenges & Gaps

1. **No official data**: Maset (opened Oct 2025) has no published nutrition information
2. **No delivery platform data**: Not on Deliveroo/Uber Eats at research time
3. **Portion variation**: Restaurant portions may vary ±15-20g from 220g estimate
4. **Oil type uncertainty**: Vegetable/sunflower assumed (could be duck fat or blend)
5. **Cut thickness variability**: 13mm estimated from French standards (actual 11-15mm range)
6. **Seasoning variation**: Finishing salt estimated at 0.5% of dish weight (standard practice)

#### Recommendations for Future Updates

1. **Confirm portion weight**: Request actual weight from Maset or weigh on next visit
2. **Verify oil type**: Ask kitchen whether vegetable, sunflower, duck fat, or blend
3. **Measure cut thickness**: Photo analysis with ruler reference for exact dimensions
4. **Check double-frying**: Confirm two-stage frying vs single-fry method
5. **Seasonal variation**: Potato moisture content affects water loss (higher in fresh harvest)
6. **Photo validation**: Use plate diameter to back-calculate portion weight
