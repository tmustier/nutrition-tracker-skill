# Nutrition Log Schema

Logs are organized by date: `YYYY-MM/DD.yaml`

Example: `2025-10/30.yaml` contains all meals eaten on 2025-10-30.

## File Structure

```yaml
# data/logs/2025-10/30.yaml

## Key Principles

1. **Snapshot nutrition data**: Copy full nutrition from food bank at time of logging. This ensures historical accuracy even if food bank entries are updated later.

2. **Reference food bank**: Store `food_bank_id` to track source. Set to `null` for estimated/manual entries.

3. **Flexible items**: Each entry (meal) can have multiple items. Track quantity and unit for each.

4. **Timestamping**: One timestamp per entry (meal level), not per item.

5. **Day type**: Track rest vs training day for proper target comparison.

6. **Notes**: Optional context at entry level (location, how you felt, etc.).

## Querying

**Today's totals:**
- Read `YYYY-MM/DD.yaml` for today
- Sum `nutrition` across all items in all entries
- Compare to targets from `references/health-profile.yaml`

**Weekly trends:**
- Read last 7 log files
- Sum nutrition per day
- Calculate daily averages
- Compare to targets
- Show compliance rate (days hitting targets)

**Rolling 7-day average:**
- Read last 7 log files
- Total nutrition across all days
- Divide by 7
- Compare to daily targets
