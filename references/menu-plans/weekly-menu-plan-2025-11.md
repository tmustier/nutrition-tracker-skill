## Strategic Principles

### 1. Sodium Reduction (3532mg → 2000-2200mg)

#### ✅ DO:

**Cook at home** (primary strategy):
- 80%+ of meals home-prepared or Simple Health Kitchen
- Complete control over sodium content
- Expected reduction: 1000-1500mg/day

**Use flavor alternatives**:
- Fresh herbs (basil, cilantro, parsley, oregano, dill)
- Citrus (lemon, lime juice - use liberally!)
- Garlic (fresh, roasted, or powder)
- Spices (paprika, cumin, cinnamon, black pepper)
- Vinegar (balsamic, apple cider)

**Shop smart**:
- "No salt added" canned tomatoes
- Unsalted nuts
- Fresh or frozen vegetables (not canned)
- Coconut aminos instead of soy sauce
- Low-sodium or sodium-free spice blends

**Simple Health Kitchen strategy**:
- Request "light salt" or "no added salt" when ordering
- Choose grilled proteins over breaded/fried
- Skip or limit sauces (often high sodium)

#### ❌ AVOID:

- Restaurant meals (except rare occasions)
- Processed/packaged foods
- Pre-made sauces and condiments
- Deli meats and cured meats
- Cheese (limit to 30g/day max)
- Pickled foods
- Soy sauce, teriyaki, BBQ sauce
- Seasoned salt, garlic salt
- Bouillon cubes
- Fast food

### 2. Saturated Fat Reduction (41.3g → 15-18g)

#### ✅ DO:

**Choose lean proteins** (biggest impact):
- **Ground beef**: 95/5 or 93/7 lean-to-fat ratio only
  - 95/5: 2.5g sat fat per 100g
  - 93/7: 3.5g sat fat per 100g
  - vs. 80/20: 8g sat fat per 100g
- **Chicken/Turkey**: Breast only, skin removed
  - Chicken breast: 1g sat fat per 100g
  - vs. Chicken thigh with skin: 5g sat fat per 100g
- **Fish**: All types excellent (1-2g sat fat per 100g)
  - Salmon, cod, haddock, tuna

**Choose low-fat dairy**:
- 0% Greek yogurt: 0g sat fat
- Skim milk or unsweetened almond milk: 0g sat fat
- Limit cheese to 30g/day max (parmesan for flavor)

**Measure fats carefully**:
- Pre-portion nuts (easy to over-consume)
- Measure olive oil (1 tbsp = 15ml)
- Use spray oil for cooking when possible

**Cooking methods**:
- Grill, bake, steam, roast
- Use non-stick pans to minimize oil needs

#### ❌ AVOID:

- Fatty cuts of beef (ribeye, chuck, brisket)
- Pork (bacon, sausage, pork chops)
- Chicken thighs with skin
- Full-fat dairy (whole milk, full-fat yogurt, cream)
- Butter, ghee
- Coconut oil/coconut milk
- Excessive cheese
- Fried foods
- Baked goods (pastries, cookies, cakes)

**Why this matters**: Every 100g shift from 80/20 ground beef to 95/5 saves 5.5g saturated fat!

### 3. Sugar Reduction (87.1g → 48-52g)

#### ✅ DO:

**Choose low-sugar fruits**:
- **Best**: Berries (blueberries, raspberries, strawberries) - 4-8g sugar per 100g
- **Good**: Kiwi, grapefruit, melon - 8-10g sugar per 100g
- **Moderate**: Banana (small), apples, pears - 10-12g sugar per 100g

**Eat whole fruits only**:
- Fiber slows sugar absorption
- More satiating than juice
- Includes beneficial phytonutrients

**Eliminate added sugars**:
- Check labels for: sugar, honey, syrup, nectar, molasses
- Choose plain yogurt (flavor with cinnamon and fresh fruit)
- No sweetened beverages
- No desserts (or rare special occasions)

**Use sweet spices**:
- Cinnamon creates sweetness perception
- Vanilla extract
- Nutmeg

#### ❌ AVOID:

- Fruit juice (even 100% juice)
- Dried fruit (concentrated sugars)
- High-sugar fruits: grapes, mangos, pineapple, dates
- Added sugars in any form
- Sweetened yogurts, flavored protein powder with added sugars
- Desserts, candy, chocolate (except 85%+ dark)
- Sweetened beverages (soda, sweetened coffee/tea)
- Condiments with added sugar (ketchup, BBQ sauce)

**Current sources of excess sugar** (based on your logs):
- Review November logs: Some days had 100-120g sugar
- Likely sources: Restaurant desserts, higher-sugar fruits
- This plan uses only berries and small portions of other fruits

### 4. Protein Consistency (166.8g → 175g)

#### ✅ DO:

**Hit protein at every meal**:
- Breakfast: 35-40g (oats + whey protein)
- Morning snack: 20g (Greek yogurt)
- Lunch: 50g (lean protein focus)
- Afternoon snack: 8-10g (nuts)
- Dinner: 55g (lean protein focus)
- Total: 175-180g

**Strategic protein sources**:
- Whey protein: 24g per 30g scoop (efficient)
- Chicken breast: 31g per 100g
- Salmon: 25g per 100g
- Greek yogurt: 10g per 100g
- Lentils: 9g per 100g cooked
- Ground beef (lean): 26g per 100g

**Distribution matters**:
- 30-50g per meal optimizes muscle protein synthesis
- Better than one huge protein meal
- Spread across 4-5 eating occasions

#### Track Progress:
```bash
# Weekly check
python3 scripts/calculate_nutrition_summary.py 7 --exclude-today

# Look for: "Protein: XXXg / 170g min"
# Goal: 170-185g daily average
```

### 5. Fiber Maintenance (40g+ daily)

#### ✅ DO:

**Vegetable volume** (primary strategy):
- Target: 600-800g vegetables per day
- Every lunch: 250g+ vegetables
- Every dinner: 300g+ vegetables
- Snacks: Add veggie sticks if hungry

**Top fiber sources in this plan**:
- Oats: 10g fiber per 100g dry → 8g per breakfast
- Lentils: 8g fiber per 100g cooked → 16g per dinner
- Broccoli: 2.4g per 100g → 4g per serving
- Brussels sprouts: 3.7g per 100g → 6g per serving
- Quinoa: 2.8g per 100g cooked → 6g per lunch
- Buckwheat: 10g per 100g dry → 4g per dinner
- Sweet potato: 2.5g per 100g → 5g per serving
- Berries: 2-4g per 100g → 4g per snack

**Fiber-rich meal strategy**:
- Every meal includes either: whole grain AND vegetables, OR legumes AND vegetables
- This makes hitting 40g automatic

**Track fiber by meal**:
- Breakfast: 12g
- Morning snack: 3g
- Lunch: 12-18g (high-vegetable, legume, or grain-based)
- Afternoon snack: 5g
- Dinner: 16-22g (legumes make big difference)
- Total: 48-60g (well above 40g minimum)

### 6. Potassium Boost & Na:K Ratio Optimization

**Current status**: 4335mg potassium, Na:K molar ratio 1.39
**Goal**: 4500-5000mg potassium, Na:K molar ratio ≤1.0
**Strategy**: Reduce sodium by 35% + increase potassium by 10%

#### Top Potassium Foods (emphasized in this plan):

| Food | Potassium per 100g | Servings/Week | Weekly Contribution |
|------|-------------------|---------------|---------------------|
| Salmon | 628mg | 3 x 150g | 2,826mg |
| Sweet potato | 542mg | 5 x 200g | 5,420mg |

**Weekly total from these alone**: ~19,767mg potassium
**Daily average**: 2,824mg (before adding other foods!)

**Other potassium sources in plan**: Chicken (360mg/100g), quinoa (172mg/100g), broccoli (293mg/100g), yogurt (141mg/100g), blueberries (77mg/100g)

**Expected total**: 4,800-5,200mg/day

#### Na:K Ratio Calculation:

**Current**:
- Sodium: 3532mg = 153.6 mmol
- Potassium: 4335mg = 110.9 mmol
- Molar ratio: 1.39

**Expected with this plan**:
- Sodium: 2100mg = 91.3 mmol
- Potassium: 4900mg = 125.3 mmol
- Molar ratio: 0.73 ✅ (well below 1.0 target!)

**Cardiovascular benefit**: WHO research shows Na:K molar ratio <1.0 associated with:
- Reduced blood pressure
- Lower stroke risk
- Improved cardiovascular health markers

## Tracking & Adjustment Protocol

### Daily Quick Check

**After logging meals**:
```bash
# Quick visual check (no need to run script)
- Did I hit ~170-180g protein today? (Check breakfast+lunch+dinner = 35+50+55 = 140g minimum from main meals)
- Did I include vegetables at lunch AND dinner? (Fiber automatically ~40g)
- Did I add salt to anything? (Should be NO)
- Did I use lean proteins? (Check meat labels: 93/7 or leaner)
```

### Weekly Analysis (Every Sunday)

**Run 7-day summary**:
```bash
python3 scripts/calculate_nutrition_summary.py 7 --exclude-today
```

**Success indicators**:
- ✅ Energy: 2500-2900 kcal depending on training/rest days
- ✅ Protein: 170-185g daily average
- ✅ Fiber: 40g+ daily average
- ✅ Sodium: <2300mg (ideally 2000-2200mg)
- ✅ Sat Fat: <20g (ideally 15-18g)
- ✅ Potassium: 4000mg+ (ideally 4500mg+)

**If off-target**:
- **Protein low (<170g)**: Add 1 scoop whey protein to afternoon snack
- **Sodium high (>2300mg)**: Review logs for hidden sodium (restaurant meal? Pre-made sauce?)
- **Sat fat high (>20g)**: Check meat ratios (was it 93/7 or 85/15?), reduce cheese/nuts
- **Fiber low (<40g)**: Add 1 cup extra vegetables at dinner

### Bi-Weekly Pattern Analysis

**Run daily comparison**:
```bash
python3 scripts/daily_comparison.py 2025-11 --days 14
```

**Look for**:
- Consistency across days (fewer outlier days)
- Training vs rest day differences (should see ~400 kcal difference)
- Which nutrients still have high variability (CV >20%)
- Outlier days (investigate what was different)

**Pattern questions**:
- Am I hitting targets on training days?
- Am I hitting targets on rest days?
- Do I see day-of-week patterns? (e.g., weekends different?)
- Which specific days were outliers and why?

### Monthly Deep Dive

**Run monthly analysis**:
```bash
python3 scripts/monthly_analysis.py 2025-11
```

**Generated report includes**:
- Executive summary with compliance %
- Meal timing and eating window analysis
- Comprehensive micronutrient breakdown (all 52 nutrients)
- Diet quality score (target: 85+)
- Strengths and areas for improvement
- Health implications
- Specific recommendations

**Success metrics**:
- Overall compliance: >75% (up from 44%)
- Diet quality score: >85 (up from 70.5)
- Na:K molar ratio: <1.0 (down from 1.39)
- Saturated fat: <20g average (down from 41.3g)
- All minimums met consistently

### Adjustment Decision Tree

#### If Protein Consistently Low (<170g for 3+ days)

**Option A**: Increase whey protein servings
- Add 1 scoop to afternoon snack (+24g protein, +120 kcal)

**Option B**: Increase protein portion sizes
- Lunch: 150g → 180g chicken (+9g protein, +30 kcal)
- Dinner: 150g → 180g protein source (+9g protein, +30 kcal)

**Option C**: Add protein-rich evening snack
- 150g Greek yogurt (+15g protein, +90 kcal)

#### If Sodium Consistently High (>2300mg for 3+ days)

**Investigate**:
1. Review food logs - which meals are high?
2. Check Simple Health Kitchen orders (request no salt)
3. Review any pre-made ingredients (canned goods, condiments)

**Solutions**:
- Make own tomato sauce from fresh tomatoes
- Reduce cheese portions (cheese is ~600mg sodium per 30g)
- Check meat (some pre-seasoned - buy plain)
- Stop any restaurant meals temporarily

#### If Saturated Fat Consistently High (>20g for 3+ days)

**Investigate**:
1. Check ground beef ratio (should see 93/7 or 95/5 on package)
2. Check dairy (should be 0% yogurt, skim milk)
3. Review nut portions (should be measured 15-20g)
4. Check cooking oils (should be minimal)

**Solutions**:
- Switch to 95/5 ground beef if using 93/7
- Reduce nut portions to 15g
- Use chicken breast more often than beef
- Increase fish frequency (lower sat fat than poultry)

#### If Energy Too Low (<2400 on training day for 3+ days)

**Add calories from healthy sources**:
- Increase grain portions: quinoa, buckwheat, rice
- Add more starchy vegetables: sweet potato, regular potato
- Slightly more healthy fats: avocado, nuts, olive oil
- Additional fruit servings

#### If Energy Too High (>3000 on rest day for 3+ days)

**Reduce calories**:
- Decrease grain portions (use rest day template more strictly)
- Reduce healthy fats by 10-15%
- Check for hidden calories (oils, nuts, nut butters)
- Use smaller plates to naturally reduce portions

### Restaurant/Social Occasion Strategy

**Frequency**: Maximum 1x per week to maintain sodium control

#### Before You Go:
- Review menu online if possible
- Eat a small protein snack before (less likely to overeat)
- Drink water

#### Ordering Strategy:

**✅ Choose**:
- Grilled, baked, or steamed proteins (chicken, fish, shrimp)
- Side of steamed or roasted vegetables (double portion)
- Side salad with dressing on the side
- Plain grains (brown rice, quinoa, plain potato)
- Ask for: "No salt added" or "light salt"
- Ask for: Sauces and dressings on the side

**❌ Avoid**:
- Fried foods
- Breaded items
- Creamy sauces (alfredo, carbonara)
- Dishes described as "crispy," "smothered," "loaded"
- Appetizers (often very high sodium)
- Bread basket
- Dessert (or split one with 3-4 people)

**Drinks**:
- Water with lemon
- Unsweetened tea
- If alcohol: max 1-2 drinks (wine, spirits + soda water)

#### Portion Control:
- Request half portion or appetizer size
- Box half the meal immediately
- Share an entree with dining partner

#### After Restaurant Meal:
**Next day strategy**:
- Return strictly to plan
- Focus on extra vegetables and water
- Expect temporary sodium spike in logs (okay once per week)
- Don't try to "compensate" by undereating

---

## Special Situations

### Travel

**Pack These**:
- Protein powder (individual packets or measured portions)
- Raw unsalted nuts (pre-portioned bags)
- Protein bars (low sugar, low sodium - check labels)
- Oats (instant plain oats in packets)

**Hotel Strategies**:
- Request mini fridge
- Find nearby grocery store (buy Greek yogurt, berries, pre-cooked chicken)
- Look for hotels with kitchenette
- Use microwave for oatmeal, steamed vegetables

**Restaurant Heavy Days**:
- Stick to ordering strategy above
- One restaurant meal per day maximum
- Other meals: Grocery store prepared foods (rotisserie chicken, salad bar, fruit)

### Sick Days

**Priorities**:
- Hydration
- Protein maintenance (easier sources: Greek yogurt, whey protein, eggs)
- Don't worry about perfect macros
- Soup is excellent (make your own low-sodium version)

**Simple Sick Day Meal**:
- Chicken and vegetable soup (homemade)
- Greek yogurt with berries
- Toast with avocado
- Whey protein shake

### Very Busy Days

**Minimal Prep Options**:
- Breakfast: Overnight oats (prepared night before)
- Lunch: Simple Health Kitchen order
- Snacks: Pre-portioned nuts, fruit, Greek yogurt cups
- Dinner: Defrost frozen batch-cooked meal (turkey meatballs, Bolognese)

**15-Minute Dinners**:
- Grilled chicken breast (pre-cooked, sliced) + microwave sweet potato + bag of steamed broccoli
- Canned tuna + mixed greens + canned no-salt beans + lemon dressing
- Scrambled eggs (egg whites) + whole grain toast + avocado + tomatoes

### Alcohol Consumption

**Current status**: 20.9 drinks/week (November average) - significantly above moderate guidelines (7-14/week)

**This plan recommendation**: Reduce to ≤7 drinks/week

**Strategy**:
- Designate 5 alcohol-free days per week
- On drinking days: limit to 1-2 drinks
- Choose: wine (120-130 kcal per 5oz) or spirits + soda water (100 kcal)
- Avoid: beer (150-200 kcal), cocktails with juice/syrup (200-400 kcal)
- Always eat before drinking
- Alternate alcoholic drinks with water

**Why reduce**:
- Alcohol adds empty calories (current impact: ~2900 kcal/week)
- Impairs protein synthesis and recovery
- Disrupts sleep quality
- Increases sodium retention
- Affects decision-making (more likely to eat off-plan)

## Advanced Optimization Tips

### Nutrient Timing

**Pre-Training** (if training fasted or after light breakfast):
- Not applicable if you train in evening after eating all day
- If morning training: small protein + carb snack 30-60 min before (banana + whey shake)

**Post-Training**:
- Your next scheduled meal is perfect
- Aim to eat within 2 hours
- Ensure 30-50g protein + 80-100g carbs

**Before Bed**:
- If hungry: slow-digesting protein is good (Greek yogurt)
- Avoid large meals 2-3 hours before bed

### Eating Window

**Current**: 12.3 hours average (extended)

**Optimization** (optional):
- Consider tightening to 10-11 hours (e.g., 8am-6pm or 9am-7pm)
- Can improve metabolic markers
- Easier to maintain calorie targets
- Not required, but worth testing

**Implementation**:
- Keep same meal schedule, just stop evening snacking
- If dinner is 7pm, breakfast at 9am = 10-hour window

### Supplement Considerations

**Currently using**:
- Whey protein (good!)

**Could consider** (discuss with doctor):
- Vitamin D: Your logs show 2.2 μg/day average, RDA is 15 μg (if blood test shows deficiency)
- Omega-3 (EPA/DHA): If you reduce fish frequency (current plan has 3x/week salmon, likely adequate)
- Magnesium: Getting ~480mg from food (target 400mg), currently good

**Do NOT need**:
- Multivitamin (getting nutrients from food)
- Protein powder beyond current use (hitting targets with food)
- BCAAs (adequate protein intake)
- Pre-workout (unless you enjoy it)

### Kitchen Equipment That Helps

**High Value**:
- Food scale (essential for accuracy)
- Large non-stick pan (for stir-fries with minimal oil)
- Instant-read meat thermometer (perfectly cooked chicken = better adherence)
- Glass meal prep containers (batch cooking)
- Rice cooker (set and forget grains)

**Nice to Have**:
- Spiralizer (zucchini noodles)
- Air fryer (crispy with minimal oil)
- Instant Pot (fast bean and grain cooking)
- Herb keeper (fresh herbs last longer)

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### "I'm Still Hungry"

**Solutions**:
1. **Add more vegetables**: 200-300g extra vegetables = +60-90 kcal, very filling
2. **Increase protein slightly**: +20g protein = +100 kcal, highly satiating
3. **Check meal timing**: Are you going >5 hours between meals? Add snack
4. **Drink more water**: Often thirst feels like hunger
5. **Eat more slowly**: 20-minute minimum per meal
6. **Add volume**: Soup, salad, vegetables before main course

**Do NOT**:
- Add empty calories (crackers, chips)
- Increase fats significantly (easy to overshoot calories)
- Go below 2400 kcal on rest days or 2800 on training days

### "I'm Too Full"

**Solutions**:
1. **Distribute eating more evenly**: Smaller, more frequent meals
2. **Liquid calories**: Smoothie for breakfast instead of whole meal
3. **Less fibrous vegetables temporarily**: 600g instead of 800g
4. **Patience**: Stomach adjusts to high-fiber diet in 1-2 weeks

### "It's Too Much Cooking"

**Solutions**:
1. **Increase Simple Health Kitchen orders**: 4-5x per week instead of 2-3x
2. **Double batch cooking**: Cook once, eat twice (or three times)
3. **Focus on simple dinners**: Grilled protein + roasted vegetables + microwave sweet potato = 15 minutes
4. **Use frozen vegetables**: Pre-cut, just as nutritious, super fast
5. **Cook on weekends only**: Batch everything, reheat all week

**Minimal Cooking Plan**:
- Breakfast: Overnight oats (no cooking)
- Lunch: Simple Health Kitchen (no cooking)
- Snacks: Greek yogurt + fruit + nuts (no cooking)
- Dinner: Sunday batch = 7 servings, just reheat (cooking 1x per week)

### "I Don't Like ___ Food"

**Swap Principles**:
- **Don't like salmon?** Use any fish (cod, tilapia, tuna)
- **Don't like Brussels sprouts?** Use broccoli, green beans, asparagus
- **Don't like quinoa?** Use brown rice, buckwheat, barley
- **Don't like ground beef?** Use ground turkey for everything
- **Don't like Greek yogurt?** Use Skyr, cottage cheese (low-fat), or extra whey protein

**Key is maintaining**:
- Same protein content
- Similar fat content (especially saturated fat)
- Similar sodium content
- Similar preparation method

### "I Ate Off-Plan"

**Do NOT**:
- Skip next meal to "compensate"
- Over-exercise to "burn it off"
- Restrict severely the next day
- Give up on the whole plan

**DO**:
- Log it honestly (learn from it)
- Return to plan at very next meal (not tomorrow, NEXT MEAL)
- Drink extra water if high-sodium meal
- Reflect: What triggered it? How to prevent next time?
- Move on (one meal doesn't erase a week of good eating)

### "The Numbers Don't Match"

**If weekly tracking shows you're off target**:

1. **Check portion sizes**: Use food scale for 1 week to recalibrate eyeballing
2. **Check meat ratios**: Is package actually 93/7 or did you grab 85/15?
3. **Check hidden sodium**: Sauces, pre-seasoned items, cheese
4. **Check cooking oils**: Easy to add 2-3 tbsp without noticing = +30g fat
5. **Check snacking**: Small bites throughout day add up

**Recalibration week**:
- Weigh and measure EVERYTHING for 7 days
- Include cooking oils, condiments, nibbles
- Compare logged values to tracking tool
- Identify discrepancies

## Appendix C: Food Bank Integration

### Creating New Food Bank Entries

As you add foods not currently in your food bank, create entries following the Schema V2 format. Use Claude or the nutrition estimation guidelines in `/home/user/nutrition-tracking/ESTIMATE.md`.

**Priority foods to add from this plan**:
1. Upgraded Homemade Bolognese with Lentils (new version)
2. Salmon Power Bowl (full recipe with all components)
3. Turkey & Lentil Plate
4. Chicken Quinoa Bowl (with tahini dressing)
5. Fish & Chips (healthy version)
6. Turkey Meatballs with Zoodles
7. Asian-Inspired Beef & Buckwheat (already exists, may need update)
8. Mediterranean Chicken
9. Chicken Stir-Fry with Cashews
10. Baked Salmon with Roasted Vegetables

### Updating Existing Entries

Some foods you already have may need portion size adjustments to match this plan. Use the `Edit` tool or create new versions.

### Portion Calculation

When logging, use these standard portions from this plan:
- Chicken breast: 180-200g cooked
- Salmon: 150-180g cooked
- Ground beef/turkey: 150g cooked
- Quinoa: 150-200g cooked
- Vegetables: 150-300g depending on meal
- Greek yogurt: 170g
- Oats: 80g dry

## Appendix D: Scientific Rationale

### Body Recomposition Targets

**Protein: 170-180g (2.0-2.1g/kg)**
- Research shows 1.6-2.2g/kg optimal for muscle preservation during body recomposition
- Higher end needed when in caloric deficit or maintenance
- Distributed across 4-5 meals = optimal muscle protein synthesis

**Calorie Targets**:
- Training days: 2900 kcal (small surplus supports training)
- Rest days: 2500 kcal (small deficit creates recomposition)
- Weekly average: ~2740 kcal (maintenance with slight deficit)

**Why this works**: Cycling calories based on training allows muscle growth on training days and fat loss on rest days, while high protein preserves lean mass.

### Cardiovascular Health Targets

**Sodium: <2300mg**
- WHO recommendation for blood pressure management
- DASH diet target
- Reduces fluid retention and blood pressure

**Potassium: 4000-4700mg**
- WHO recommendation for cardiovascular health
- Counteracts sodium effects on blood pressure
- Supports nerve and muscle function

**Na:K Molar Ratio <1.0**
- Strong predictor of cardiovascular events (better than sodium alone)
- Ratio of sodium ions to potassium ions (what your body responds to)
- This plan targets 0.7-0.9 ratio

**Saturated Fat: <20g (<7% of calories)**
- American Heart Association recommendation
- LDL cholesterol reduction
- CVD risk reduction

### Fiber: 40g+

**Benefits**:
- Blood sugar stabilization
- Cholesterol reduction (especially soluble fiber)
- Gut microbiome health
- Satiety and weight management
- Colon cancer prevention

**Evidence**: Higher fiber intakes (38-50g) associated with better health outcomes than minimum recommendations (25-30g).

### Micronutrient Completeness

This plan provides adequate amounts of all essential micronutrients through whole food sources:
- **B-vitamins**: Whole grains, lean meats, legumes
- **Vitamins A/C/E/K**: Colorful vegetables, berries
- **Vitamin D**: Salmon, fortified foods (may need supplement in winter)
- **Minerals**: Wide variety of plant and animal foods
- **Omega-3**: Salmon 3x/week provides EPA/DHA
