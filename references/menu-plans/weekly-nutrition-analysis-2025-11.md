## Health Impact Analysis

### 🫀 Cardiovascular Health
**Na:K Molar Ratio: 1.39 → 0.24 (↓82%)**

- **Current**: 1.39 (above WHO ideal of ≤1.0)
- **Plan**: 0.24 (well below ideal)
- **Impact**: Exceptional improvement in cardiovascular disease risk profile

**WHO Research**: Na:K molar ratio <1.0 associated with:
- Reduced blood pressure
- Lower stroke risk
- Improved cardiovascular health markers

**This plan achieves 0.24** - among the best achievable ratios on a normal diet.

---

### 🫀 Saturated Fat Reduction
**41.3g → 12.2g (↓71%)**

- **Current**: 207% over target (41.3g vs 20g limit)
- **Plan**: 61% of target (12.2g vs 20g limit)
- **Impact**: LDL cholesterol reduction, improved cardiovascular health

**Percentage of calories from saturated fat**:
- Current: 12.1% (above AHA recommendation of <7%)
- Plan: 4.7% (well below AHA recommendation) ✅

---

### 🔥 Energy Balance for Body Recomposition
**3,072 kcal → 2,353 kcal (↓719 kcal/day)**

- **Training days**: 2,414 kcal (486 kcal deficit from current)
- **Rest days**: 2,201 kcal (871 kcal deficit from current)
- **Weekly deficit**: ~5,033 kcal total

**Body Recomposition Implications**:
