special_considerations:

  salt_and_iodization:
    uk_status: "No mandatory salt iodization"

    iodized_salt:
      iodine_content: "20-40 μg per 1g salt (varies by brand)"
      availability: "Available but only ~5% market share in UK"
      when_assumed: "Only if explicitly stated on label/ingredients"
      calculation: "1g iodized salt ≈ 30 μg iodine (midpoint)"

    sea_salt_himalayan:
      iodine_content: "Negligible (<1 μg/g) - NEVER assume iodine content"
      uk_trend: "Increasing popularity reduces iodine intake"

    bread_industry:
      historical: "Iodized salt commonly used 1960s-1980s"
      current: "Voluntary; some large bakeries still use it, small/artisan usually don't"
      estimation: "Assume 10 μg/100g unless 'iodized salt' listed"

  cooking_and_processing:

    heat_stability:
      effect: "Iodine stable up to 100°C"
      loss: "Minimal loss in baking, boiling, frying"
      exception: "High heat + prolonged (>1 hour) may reduce 10-20%"
      recommendation: "Ignore cooking losses for most dishes"

    water_cooking:
      pasta_rice: "Cooked in water - iodine not significantly added from water"
      vegetables: "Boiled vegetables - minimal iodine loss to water"

    processing_effects:
      canning: "Tuna/salmon - 20-40% loss during canning"
      freezing: "No effect on iodine content"
      drying: "Concentrates iodine per gram (e.g., milk → milk powder)"

  bioavailability:
    factors_reducing_absorption:
      - "Goitrogens in cruciferous vegetables (broccoli, cabbage, kale)"
      - "Soy isoflavones (tofu, soy milk)"
      - "High selenium intake (interferes with thyroid)"
      - "Thiocyanate from smoking"

    note: "This guide provides dietary iodine content, not absorbed iodine"

    practical: "Don't adjust estimates for bioavailability - beyond scope of food tracking"

  vegan_vegetarian:

      recommendation: "Vegans should use iodine supplement (150 μg) or fortified foods"

      - "Dairy + eggs can meet RNI"

      - "Many UK pregnant women inadequate (67% below WHO threshold)"
      - "Nausea may reduce dairy intake"
      - "Often advised to avoid certain fish (reduces iodine source)"

    recommendations:
      - "150 μg supplement commonly recommended in UK pregnancy"

# RECOMMENDED WORKFLOW
# =============================================================================

workflow:
  for_new_dish:
    steps:
      1:
        action: "Identify iodine-rich components"
        check: "Does dish contain dairy, seafood, or eggs?"

      2:
        action: "Estimate high-confidence components"
        priority: "Dairy (HIGH) > Seafood/Eggs (MEDIUM) > Others (LOW)"

      3:
        action: "Decide on low-confidence components"
        options:
          - "Estimate if major component (>50g) and data available"
          - "Set to 0 if minor or very low confidence"
          - "ALWAYS document decision"

      4:
        action: "Calculate total"
        method: "Sum component estimates"

      5:
        action: "Document"
        required:
          - "Confidence level"
          - "Ranges/values used"
          - "Why set to 0 if applicable"

      6:
        action: "Validate"
        checks:
          - "Plausibility (20-400 μg range for meal)"
          - "Dairy not set to 0"
          - "Documentation complete"

  time_estimates:
    simple_dish_dairy_based: "2-3 minutes"
    mixed_dish_with_fish: "5-7 minutes"
    complex_restaurant_dish: "10-15 minutes (more unknowns)"

  when_to_skip:
    reasons:
      - "One-off dish unlikely to repeat"
      - "Only vegetables/fruits (negligible iodine)"
      - "Time pressure + low confidence components only"
    note: "Setting to 0 with documentation is acceptable - don't waste effort on poor estimates"
