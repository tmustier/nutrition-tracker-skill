  overview: |
    EXTREME VARIABILITY - "particularly difficult to assess... plants highly
    sensitive to soil concentrations, leading to great variation" (NCBI).
    UK soils generally selenium-poor compared to North America.
    Animal products more reliable (selenium in feed controlled).

  uk_specific_notes: |
    UK soil is selenium-poor (glaciation removed topsoil selenium).
    UK wheat averages 20-30 µg/100g vs US wheat 50-70 µg/100g.
    UK government considered selenium flour fortification in 1990s but rejected.
    Current UK intake: ~40 µg/day (below 75 µg RNI for men).
    Most reliable UK sources: meat, fish, eggs (feed-supplemented).

  estimation_strategy: |
    SAFE DEFAULT: Set to 0 for most foods.
    ONLY ESTIMATE for:
    - Brazil nuts (if specific origin known)
    - Seafood (use USDA values)
    - Meat/eggs (use conservative USDA values)
    - DO NOT estimate for plant foods (too variable)

    Tea is major dietary source in UK (4-5 cups = 1.6-2mg).
    Whole grain consumption correlates with manganese intake.

  estimation_strategy: |
    TIER 1 PRIORITY (if USDA available):
    - Whole grains, nuts, seeds → use USDA values
    - Legumes → use USDA values
    - Tea → estimate from dry weight

    TIER 2 (estimate if feasible):
    - Vegetables → use USDA values or 0.1-0.3mg default

    SAFE TO SET TO ZERO:
    - Meat, poultry, fish (trace only)
    - Dairy (negligible)
    - Refined grains (heavily reduced)
    - Oils, fats, pure sugars (true zero)

    Northern latitude (limited winter sun) = low synthesis Oct-Mar.

  uk_specific_notes: |
    UK safe intake: 3-7 mg/day (no specific RNI due to widespread availability).
    No UK fortification programs (not needed - ubiquitous in foods).
    Deficiency virtually unknown in free-living populations.
    Name origin: "pantothen" (Greek) = from everywhere.
    UK intake typically 5-8 mg/day (adequate).

  estimation_strategy: |
    TIER 1 PRIORITY (if feasible):
    - Liver → use USDA values (very high)
    - Mushrooms → use USDA values
    - Eggs → 1.5mg per 100g
    - Sunflower seeds → 7.0mg per 100g (exceptionally high)

    TIER 2 (estimate if feasible):
    - Meat, poultry, fish → use USDA values
    - Avocado → 1.5mg per 100g
    - Legumes → use USDA values
    - Whole grains → use USDA values

    SAFE TO SET TO ZERO OR TRACE:
    - Refined grains (reduced) → low but not zero
    - Most vegetables (except sweet potato) → low
    - Most fruits (except avocado) → low
    - Oils, fats, pure sugars (true zero)

    NOTE: Deficiency not a practical concern. Low priority for estimation effort.
