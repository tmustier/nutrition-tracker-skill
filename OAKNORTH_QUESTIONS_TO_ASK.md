## 1. ROLE DEFINITION QUESTIONS
*Critical for understanding this unique one-off position*

### On Role Genesis
- **What specific inflection point or challenge prompted the creation of this Operating Partner role now?** Given your track record of exceptional execution with Joel over 23 years, I'm curious what new dimension of complexity or scale demands a different type of leadership support.

- **Is this role architected as a permanent executive function that evolves with the company, or is it scoped as a 2-3 year transformation mandate?** Understanding the intended lifecycle helps me think about how to structure impact and succession.

- **How do you distinguish between what this Operating Partner role should own versus what remains with your existing C-suite?** Specifically, where do responsibilities begin and end relative to your COO, CTO, and functional heads?

### On Role Evolution
- **What would success look like such that you'd say "we need a second Operating Partner" versus "this should remain a singular role"?** This reveals whether you see this as a scalable model or a unique response to current circumstances.

- **How do you envision this role transforming over 12, 24, and 36-month horizons?** As US operations mature and OpenAI integrations deepen, I imagine the strategic priorities shift significantly.

- **What happens if this role works brilliantly?** Does it eventually split into multiple functional executives, consolidate into a COO structure, or maintain its current configuration?

## 2. CEO PARTNERSHIP QUESTIONS
*Understanding the dynamics with Rishi Khosla*

### On Working Relationship
- **You and Joel have a 23-year partnership with deeply embedded trust and shorthand. How do you envision an Operating Partner complementing that dynamic without disrupting it?** I'm thinking about both the practical coordination and the interpersonal chemistry.

- **What's worked best and worst when you've brought senior external executives into your leadership orbit?** Specifically, what did the successful integrations do that the unsuccessful ones missed?

- **How do you prefer to receive challenge or pushback on strategic decisions?** Is it real-time in meetings, written memos beforehand, private conversations afterward, or some combination?

### On Decision-Making
- **What does "good" look like in our working relationship six months in?** Paint me a picture of a week where the Operating Partner role is firing on all cylinders.

- **Where do you want an Operating Partner to be autonomous versus highly coordinated with you?** Help me understand the decision rights and escalation protocols you envision.

- **Given your "10x not 10%" philosophy, how do you balance moving fast with an OP who's still climbing the learning curve on fintech specifics?** What's the ramp-up versus impact expectation curve?

## 3. STRATEGIC PRIORITIES QUESTIONS
*Understanding the mission-critical initiatives*

### On Current Bottlenecks
- **What 2-3 mission-critical initiatives keep you up at night that an Operating Partner would directly impact?** I want to understand where the ceiling is on your growth or execution right now.

- **Where are the biggest bottlenecks to scaling efficiently?** Is it talent density, operational process maturity, technology infrastructure, market execution, or something else entirely?

- **You're managing UK optimization (£12.5BN book), US expansion (multi-billion ambition), and ONCI platform growth. How should an Operating Partner allocate focus across these three vectors?** What's the priority stack rank today, and how might it shift in 2025-2026?

### On Recent Strategic Moves
- **The Community Unity Bank acquisition is a significant move. What are the 3-6 month integration priorities, and how does the Operating Partner role factor into that?** Is this a template for future US acquisitions or a unique opportunity?

- **The OpenAI partnership signals major conviction on GenAI. Where do you see the biggest opportunities for AI to create leverage in OakNorth's operating model?** And where does an OP drive that versus your CTO organization?

- **Lord Adair Turner's appointment as Chair suggests potential IPO preparation. Without asking you to comment on timing, how should an Operating Partner think about building IPO-ready operational rigor?** What needs to be enterprise-grade that's currently been "good enough"?

## 4. OPERATING MODEL QUESTIONS
*Understanding organizational dynamics and gaps*

### On Executive Team Dynamics
- **Where does your exec team collaborate exceptionally well, and where do you see friction or gaps?** I'm looking for honest insight into what's working and what needs reinforcement.

- **What operating cadences and rituals do you have today (weekly leadership, quarterly planning, etc.), and what's missing that an OP should establish?** How much structure versus fluidity do you want?

- **You have a flat organizational culture. How does a senior Operating Partner integrate without creating accidental hierarchy or bureaucracy?** What are the cultural guardrails?

### On Operational Gaps
- **What processes or systems are breaking as you scale?** Where are you currently "holding things together with duct tape" that needs institutional muscle?

- **Between UK operations at maturity and US operations scaling rapidly, where do you see the biggest delta in operational sophistication?** Should the OP be standardizing best practices or letting contexts diverge?

- **You're a top 1% performing bank with 22% ROE and 26-28% efficiency. What threatens those metrics as you scale, and how does an OP protect them?** Where's the efficiency at risk?

### On Technology & Automation
- **With the OpenAI partnership, how do you see GenAI and automation creating leverage in ways traditional fintech hasn't?** Where should an OP push for automation versus defend human judgment?

- **ONCI is your platform business. How should an Operating Partner think about the build/operate/grow balance for ONCI versus direct lending operations?** Are these parallel businesses or deeply integrated?

## 5. SUCCESS METRICS QUESTIONS
*Defining clear outcomes and accountability*

### On Measurement
- **How will you measure Operating Partner success in Year 1? Year 2?** Give me the 3-5 KPIs or outcomes that would make you say "this hire was brilliant."

- **What outcomes matter most: revenue growth, operational efficiency, risk management, team capability building, strategic project delivery, or something else?** Help me understand the weighting.

- **What would failure look like?** Not in a catastrophic sense, but what are the signals at 6-12 months that would indicate this isn't working?

### On Strategic Contribution
- **You're potentially preparing for an IPO. What specific operational or organizational gaps need to close for OakNorth to be IPO-ready, and what's the OP's role in that?** Think audit readiness, governance, reporting infrastructure, etc.

- **How do you want an Operating Partner to balance "firefighting" immediate operational issues versus building long-term institutional capabilities?** What's the 80/20 split?

## 6. CULTURE FIT QUESTIONS
*Understanding OakNorth's unique cultural dynamics*

### On Values in Practice
- **Your values include "10x not 10%" and "zero base thinking." Can you share an example where those two principles were in tension?** How did you navigate the tradeoff between ambitious moonshots and fundamental questioning of assumptions?

- **"Zero base" implies constantly questioning status quo. How does that work in practice when you're also trying to scale and systematize operations?** When do you preserve versus reinvent?

- **What does "10x not 10%" look like operationally versus strategically?** I can imagine it shaping product vision, but how does it manifest in how you run the bank day-to-day?

### On Integration and Culture
- **You have a flat org and a 23-year founder partnership. What's your advice for a new executive integrating into this environment without disrupting what makes it work?** What have you seen work and fail?

- **What's the biggest cultural challenge someone from outside fintech faces at OakNorth?** Is it the regulatory rigor, the pace, the risk mindset, or something else?

## QUESTION USAGE STRATEGY

**Pre-Interview Preparation:**
- Select 8-12 questions that best match the interview stage and interviewer
- Prioritize Role Definition and CEO Partnership questions early
- Save deeper Strategic Priorities and Vision questions for later rounds

**During Interview:**
- Use these as conversation starters, not interrogation scripts
- Listen for answers that prompt follow-up questions
- Weave in examples of how you'd approach the challenges they describe

**Red Flags to Listen For:**
- Vague answers on role definition (suggests undefined scope)
- Misalignment between CEO's vision and operational reality
- Unrealistic expectations on ramp-up time or immediate impact
- Cultural rigidity that might not accommodate external perspective

**Green Flags to Listen For:**
- Specific examples and stories (shows authentic thinking)
- Comfort with ambiguity and evolution of the role
- Recognition of what they don't know or need help with
- Excitement about potential partnership versus just filling a gap
