## 1. Oil and Fat Absorption

### 1.1 Deep Frying

#### Quantitative Absorption Rates

**Standard Deep Frying (No Coating):**
- **Range:** 8-25% oil absorption by weight
- **Typical:** 10% rule (industry standard estimation)
- **Temperature:** 325-375°F (160-190°C)

**With Breading/Batter:**
- **Breaded foods:** 15-50% oil absorption
- **Battered foods:** 20-40% oil absorption
- **Effect of coating:** Increases surface area and creates porous structure

#### Factors Affecting Oil Absorption

**1. Temperature (Critical Factor)**
- **Lower temperatures (150-160°C):** Increased oil absorption, lighter color, less crust formation
- **Optimal temperatures (160-180°C):** Standard absorption rates (8-25%)
- **Higher temperatures (>180°C):** Reduced oil absorption, thinner crust, faster surface sealing
- **Mechanism:** Temperature affects crust formation rate and surface sealing

**2. Food Moisture Content**
- **High moisture foods** (fish, chicken): Potentially higher absorption as water evaporates
- **Lower moisture foods** (French fries, doughnuts): Less absorption
- **Key mechanism:** Oil occupies spaces left by evaporated water
- **Primary absorption:** Occurs during COOLING phase (post-frying), not during frying
- **Vapor condensation:** Creates favorable pressure gradient for oil entry

**3. Surface Area to Mass Ratio**
- **Smaller/thinner items:** Higher absorption per unit weight (more surface area)
- **Larger/thicker items:** Lower absorption percentage
- **Example:** Shoestring fries absorb more oil per weight than thick-cut fries

**4. Coating Type and Application**

| Coating Type | Oil Reduction | Mechanism |
|--------------|---------------|-----------|
| Gel coatings (Aloe vera, hydrocolloids) | Up to 50% | Forms moisture barrier |
| Protein isolates (soy, whey) | 35-40% | Physical barrier, modified microstructure |
| Methylcellulose | 35-40% | Barrier formation |
| Alternative flours | 20-30% | Increased water retention |
| Sweet potato starch (batter) | Most effective for nuggets | Microstructure modification |

**5. Frying Time**
- Longer frying = more moisture loss = more space for oil
- Critical: Most oil absorption occurs during **cooling**, not during active frying

**6. Food Microstructure and Porosity**

**Advanced Research (Nature Communications 2025):**
- **Pore size effect:** Pores 10-100 μm diameter account for 49-67% of total pore volume
- **Oil uptake mechanism:** Capillary action in small crust pores during cooling
- **Surface roughness:** Greater roughness = increased oil absorption
- **Crust formation:** Higher temperatures create distinguished crust with surface openings

#### Oil Absorption by Food Type

| Food Type | Oil Absorption % | Notes |
|-----------|------------------|-------|
| French fries (standard) | 8-15% | Lower moisture, optimal cooking |
| Breaded chicken | 15-25% | Coating increases absorption |
| Battered fish | 20-30% | Porous batter structure |
| Chicken nuggets | 15-20% | Depends on coating |
| Doughnuts | 10-15% | Low moisture content |
| Eggplant | 20-40% | "Sponge effect" - highly porous |

### 1.2 Pan Frying and Shallow Frying

#### Key Finding: Similar Absorption to Deep Frying

**Absorption Rate:** 8-25% (comparable to deep frying when done at proper temperatures)

**Why Shallow Frying Isn't Lower:**
- Despite using less oil overall, the food still contacts hot oil surface
- Surface sealing and absorption mechanisms remain the same
- The reduced oil volume doesn't reduce absorption percentage

**Temperature Effects:**
- **Lower temperatures:** Increased absorption (same as deep frying)
- **High temperatures:** Better surface sealing, less absorption

### 1.3 Sautéing and Stir-Frying

**Absorption Characteristics:**
- **Lowest absorption** of all frying methods
- **Mechanism:** Quick cooking at high heat, minimal contact time
- **Most oil remains:** As surface coating rather than absorbed
- **Estimation:** 2-8% absorption (mostly surface coating)

**Why Less Absorption:**
1. Very short cooking time
2. Constant movement prevents prolonged contact
3. Higher temperatures promote rapid surface sealing
4. Minimal moisture loss means less space for oil entry

### 1.4 Roasting with Oil

**Absorption Profile:**
- Primarily a **surface phenomenon**
- Most oil remains as coating on exterior
- Minimal penetration into food matrix

**Surface Sealing Technique:**
- Preheating oil until very hot creates surface seal
- Hot oil caramelizes natural sugars, forming golden coating
- Prevents excessive absorption

**Vegetable-Specific Behavior:**
- **Dense vegetables** (carrots, potatoes): Minimal absorption, mostly surface coating
- **Porous vegetables** (eggplant, mushrooms): Higher absorption (15-30%)
- **Leafy vegetables** (kale, Brussels sprouts): Oil mostly as surface coating

**Estimation for Nutrition Tracking:**
- For most vegetables: Count 60-80% of oil used as coating (retained)
- For porous vegetables: Count 80-100% of oil used (absorbed + coating)
- Microstructure matters: Oil fills available pores

- **Typical addition:** 1 tablespoon salt per 4 quarts water
- **Pasta absorption:** ~¼ teaspoon per pound of pasta
- **Quantitative:** 28 mg Na/100g pasta (when cooked with 4g salt/100g raw pasta)
- **Standard recipe result:** 247 mg sodium per 140g cooked serving
- **Rinsing effect:** 34% sodium reduction

**Linear relationship:** Sodium content in cooked pasta increases linearly with salt in water

**Digestive absorption:** 90-100% of sodium in cooked pasta is absorbed in small intestine

#### Protein and Amino Acid Losses

**Fish:**
- **5 minutes boiling (100°C):** Minimal quality impact
- **Amino acid changes:** Not significant between boiled and fried
- **Protein loss mechanism:** Solubilization into cooking water

**Meat:**
- **Drip loss to cooking liquid:** Contains soluble proteins
- **Retention:** Protein structure remains intact, but some soluble components lost

**Key Finding:** While denaturation occurs, amino acid sequence remains unchanged

### 2.2 Steaming

#### Superior Nutrient Retention vs. Boiling

**Water-Soluble Vitamins:**

- **Carrots:** 70-85% retention (vs. 70% loss when boiled)
- **Broccoli:** Vitamin C well-retained
- **General:** 5-92% loss (highly variable by vegetable)

**Folate (Vitamin B9):**
- **Spinach:** Nearly 5 minutes steaming = negligible folate loss
- **Broccoli:** 15 minutes steaming = minimal folate loss
- **Comparison:** Boiling loses >50% folate in same vegetables

**Mineral Retention:**
- **Higher retention** than boiling due to minimal water contact
- No significant leaching into steam condensate

### 2.3 Poaching in Broth

#### Bidirectional Nutrient/Flavor Exchange

**Mechanism: Osmosis**
- Molecules move between concentrated and dilute solutions
- Food releases flavors and nutrients into poaching liquid
- Food absorbs flavors from poaching liquid
- Equilibrium achieved based on concentration gradients

**Nutrient Dynamics:**
- **Water-soluble vitamins:** Minimal loss compared to boiling (lower temperature)
- **Minerals:** Some leaching, but retained in flavorful broth
- **Protein solubilization:** Some loss to liquid, enriching broth

**Flavor Absorption:**
- Lower temperature + longer time = better flavor absorption
- Aromatics, spices, and complex flavors penetrate food
- **Deep poaching:** Strong flavor exchanges
- **Shallow poaching:** Subtle exchanges, preserves original flavors

**Key for Nutrition Tracking:**
- If poaching liquid is **consumed:** No net nutrient loss
- If poaching liquid is **discarded:** Count losses similar to boiling (but 20-30% less)

### 2.4 Pressure Cooking

#### Superior Nutrient Retention

**Overall Nutrient Retention:** 90-95%

**Why Pressure Cooking Preserves Nutrients:**

1. **Shorter cooking times** (most important factor)
   - Longer cooking = greater nutrient degradation
   - Pressure cooking reduces time by 50-70%

2. **Minimal water usage**
   - Less leaching of water-soluble nutrients
   - Concentrated cooking environment

3. **Sealed environment**
   - Prevents oxygen contact
   - Reduces oxidation of vitamins A, C, E, and antioxidants

**Vitamin C Retention:**
- **Pressure cooking broccoli:** 92% retention
- **Conventional steaming:** 78% retention
- **Boiling:** 66% retention

**Other Water-Soluble Vitamins:**
- **B-vitamins:** ~90% retention (vs. 40-60% with boiling)
- **Mechanism:** Reduced water contact + shorter time

**Minerals:**
- High retention since minerals aren't destroyed by heat
- Only lost if cooking liquid is discarded
- Less loss than boiling due to minimal water use

**Important Caveat:**
- High temperature can degrade nutrients if cooking time is TOO LONG
- Optimal: "Short enough" time to compensate for high temperature
- Trade-off: Temperature vs. time

### 2.5 Sous Vide

#### Minimal Moisture Loss

**Moisture Retention:**
- **Sous vide:** 5-10% weight loss
- **Traditional roasting/grilling:** 20-30% weight loss
- **Mechanism:** Vacuum-sealed environment prevents evaporation

**Nutrient Retention:**
- Excellent for vitamins and minerals
- Low temperature + sealed environment
- Minimal oxygen exposure

## 3. Other Cooking Mediums

### 3.1 Marinades

#### Penetration: Primarily a Surface Phenomenon

**Critical Finding:** Limited deep penetration

**Penetration Depth:**
- **Salt:** Deepest penetration, but takes **24 hours for 1 inch (25mm)**
- **Other marinade components:** Primarily surface (1-5mm penetration)
- **Most marinade:** Remains on surface
- **Visual inspection:** Cutting meat shows no deep penetration

**Time Factors:**

| Time Period | Absorption Rate | Effect |
|-------------|-----------------|--------|
| Initial 5 minutes | Rapid | 196% faster with phosphates |
| 5-15 minutes | Moderate | Continued surface absorption |
| 15-30 minutes | Slower | Diminishing returns |
| 120-180 minutes | Enhanced quality | Better color, aroma, flavor (surface effects) |

**Marinade Uptake Percentages:**
- **Chicken (tumble marination, 30 min):** 3-3.5% by weight
- **pH effect:** Higher uptake at pH 4.0 (3.34% uptake)

**Vacuum Sealing Enhancement:**

**Debated Effectiveness:**
- **Culinary Institute of America study:** Vacuum-sealed flank steak absorbed 37% more marinade in 30 minutes vs. 4-hour traditional soaking
- **Time reduction:** Up to 75% faster marination
- **Counter-argument:** Marination is chemical, not physical process; vacuum mainly ensures surface contact

**Practical Conclusion:**
- Marinating is primarily surface chemistry
- Core meat pH unchanged even after 180 minutes
- Effect is on surface properties: color, aroma, texture

### 3.2 Brining and Pickling

#### Salt Absorption

**Maximum Absorption:**
- **Normal brine (10-20% salt):** Meat will not exceed ~5% salt by weight
- **Mechanism:** Osmotic equilibrium limits absorption

**Smoke Absorption:**

**Temperature Window:**
- **Maximum absorption:** Below 140-150°F (60-65°C)
- **After 150°F:** Surface seals, absorption stops
- **Mechanism:** Smoke compounds dissolve in surface moisture

**Surface Moisture Effect:**
- **Wet surface:** Enhanced smoke absorption
- **Sources:** Spraying, natural moisture from meat, water pan
- **Effect:** Smoke compounds dissolve more readily in moisture
- **Result:** Enhanced smoke ring and bark formation

**Water Pan Benefits:**
1. Absorbs heat and regulates temperature
2. Increases humidity
3. Helps meat retain moisture
4. Enhances smoke absorption via surface moisture

**Moisture Retention Techniques:**

| Standard batter | 20-40% | Highly porous |
| Dense breading | 15-25% | Less porosity |

**Coating Weight:**
- Typical breading: Adds 10-20% to food weight before frying
- This additional weight then absorbs oil at higher rate than base food

**Oil Reduction Strategies:**

1. **Functional ingredients in coating:**
   - Hydrocolloids: Improve crispiness, reduce oil content
   - Alternative flours: Increase water retention, reduce oil absorption

2. **Pre-treatments:**

## 7. Key Findings Summary

### 7.1 Oil/Fat Transfer

1. **Deep frying:** 8-25% absorption is standard; breading increases to 15-50%
2. **Absorption timing:** Most occurs during COOLING (capillary action), not active frying
3. **Temperature is critical:** Higher temps → less absorption (faster surface sealing)
4. **Coating effects:** Can reduce absorption by 35-50% with optimized ingredients
5. **Microstructure matters:** Pore size (10-100 μm) determines absorption capacity
6. **Shallow frying ≈ deep frying:** Similar absorption rates despite less oil used

### 7.2 Water-Based Transfer

1. **Boiling is worst:** 40-70% vitamin loss, 30-40% mineral loss (if water discarded)
2. **Steaming is best:** 50% less nutrient loss than boiling
3. **Pressure cooking optimal:** 90-95% retention (short time compensates for high temp)
4. **Key principle:** More water = more leaching
5. **Recovery strategy:** Consuming cooking liquid reclaims 85-95% of nutrients

### 7.3 Brining and Marinating

1. **Brining adds 15-20% moisture, ~5% max salt by weight**
2. **Marinade penetration is minimal:** Primarily surface effect (<5mm depth)
3. **Salt penetrates deepest:** But still requires 24 hours for 1 inch
4. **Vacuum sealing may help:** 37% more absorption in 30 min (debated)
5. **Time matters:** Initial 5 minutes = rapid, then diminishing returns

### 7.4 Practical Tracking Implications

1. **Use 10% rule for deep frying** (no coating) as default
2. **Use 25% rule for breaded/battered frying**
3. **Boiling losses:** Reduce vitamins by 40-50%, minerals by 35%
4. **Steaming:** Minimal adjustments needed (10-15% vitamin reduction)
5. **Retained cooking liquids:** No nutrient deduction needed
6. **Discarded cooking liquids:** Apply category-specific reduction factors
